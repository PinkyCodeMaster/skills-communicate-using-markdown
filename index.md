# Markdown Cheat Sheet

This is a cheat sheet for Markdown syntax to help you quickly find and remember commands for various formatting options.

## Headings

Headings are created by adding one or more `#` symbols before your heading text. The number of `#` you use will determine the size of the heading.

```markdown
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6
```


# Links
To create a link, wrap the link text in brackets ([]) and then follow it immediately with the URL in parentheses ().
